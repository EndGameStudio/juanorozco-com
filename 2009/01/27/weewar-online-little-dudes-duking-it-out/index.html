It read, \u0026quot;Award winning turn based multi-player strategy game on Weewar.com.\u0026quot;   Well... that deserves a click!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I notice is how neat and clean the site is - very easy to use and I love easy to use!   So, I signed up for an account - they had me at \u0026quot;free\u0026quot; - and started poking around the site.   I thought the site would have all types of options and pages and links, but it is actually very simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I clicked over to \u003cem\u003eGames\u003c/em\u003e and signed up for the first game on the list, which happened to be a beginner game.   It seems that the game can be set with a time limit on player turns - each player gets no more than anywhere from 5 minutes to three days to complete their turn.   The game I am in right now is set to one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1408\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1408\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e[\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-1408\" title=\"gamescreengrab\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/gamescreengrab-300x291.png?resize=300%2C291\" alt=\"My latest game\" width=\"300\" height=\"291\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e][2]\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eMy latest game\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame play is simple, but deep.   You have bases that can create units.   Units vary in strength, armor, and movement.   Terrain ranges from mountains to forests to swamps.   There's a lot of room for strategy making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final reward for victory is an increase in points to the player's \u0026quot;rating.\u0026quot;   The rating system awards winners by transferring points from the loser to the winner.   You start off with 1500 points.   The game I am in is a 3 player map and the third player just gave up, which rewarded me with 10 points.   Woo hoo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere's a neat social aspect to the game as well.   There is a chat client as you are playing so you can taunt your opponent or, if you're like me, discuss strategies.   There's a forum, blog, and API as well.   A special tournament site exists where you can take part in a tournament of WeeWar.   Good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe free account lets you play the game with basic units, terrain, buildings and playable maps.   It also only allows you to play up to four games at a time.   A pro account can be purchased for a small fee and will grant access to all units, base types, terrains, and maps.   A pro account holder can also play up to ten games at a time.   There is a difference in map creation as well - a pro account holder can create and store more maps than a free account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found out that the game has been around since March of 2007, but it gained a lot of notoriety in early Summer of 2007 after being mentioned on big blogs like \u003ca href=\"http://kotaku.com/271729/timewaster-of-the-day-weewar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eKotaku\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/02/weewar-for-the-weekend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eTech Crunch\u003c/a\u003e.   It's been mentioned in magazines as well.   The funny thing is that I never heard of it until I ran my Google search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is fun, the people are actually very friendly, and the site is easy to use.   Players offer a very hard challenge, which I enjoy after decades of playing the \u0026quot;computer\u0026quot;.   If some players don't want to play another human, some users have created their own AI and allow anyone to invite them into a game.   Although, it doesn't sound like many of these AIs offer a good challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is fun and addicting, it will be my crack for the foreseeable future.\u003c/p\u003e"

<p>There's a neat social aspect to the game as well.   There is a chat client as you are playing so you can taunt your opponent or, if you're like me, discuss strategies.   There's a forum, blog, and API as well.   A special tournament site exists where you can take part in a tournament of WeeWar.   Good stuff.</p>
<p>The free account lets you play the game with basic units, terrain, buildings and playable maps.   It also only allows you to play up to four games at a time.   A pro account can be purchased for a small fee and will grant access to all units, base types, terrains, and maps.   A pro account holder can also play up to ten games at a time.   There is a difference in map creation as well - a pro account holder can create and store more maps than a free account.</p>
<p>I found out that the game has been around since March of 2007, but it gained a lot of notoriety in early Summer of 2007 after being mentioned on big blogs like <a href="http://kotaku.com/271729/timewaster-of-the-day-weewar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/02/weewar-for-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Crunch</a>.   It's been mentioned in magazines as well.   The funny thing is that I never heard of it until I ran my Google search.</p>
<p>The game is fun, the people are actually very friendly, and the site is easy to use.   Players offer a very hard challenge, which I enjoy after decades of playing the &quot;computer&quot;.   If some players don't want to play another human, some users have created their own AI and allow anyone to invite them into a game.   Although, it doesn't sound like many of these AIs offer a good challenge.</p>
<p>The game is fun and addicting, it will be my crack for the foreseeable future.</p>
