Â  Although Ciri's official last day isn't until May, her last day in the clinic is nigh. Â  Her Sergeant asked me to send her pictures of Ciriana in a bite suit from a re-enlistment ceremony in Germany. Â  The photo was mounted onto a plaque that Ciriana received during the luncheon - it is pretty awesome looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her Sergeant told me what she was going to do with the pictures, I didn't think about getting Ciriana anything just from me, except maybe some flowers. Â  That is, Â  until Sunday afternoon. Â  Remember that episode of Scrubs with the \u0026quot;epiphany toilet?\u0026quot; Â  Well, I get epiphany's in the bathroom too, only mine are in the shower. Â  So, there I am lathering, rinsing, and repeating, when it hits me. Â  Ciriana wanted a coin display for her challenge coins. Â  All of the ones I've seen are either ugly or just blah. Â  So... \u0026quot;Why not design and make one myself,\u0026quot; I thought as I scrubbed my nether regions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy creativity is weird. Â  It comes in waves... BIG spread out waves. Â  Once I get an idea, my creativity goes into overdrive. Â  I could do it this way, or I could do it that way... oh! It would be so cool... etc. etc. Â  It wasn't until Monday that I finally had a pretty good sketch of what I was going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Final Display\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3350680194_10b3da055e.jpg?resize=500%2C375\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about the display means something. Â  Ciriana and I have an equal amount of good and bad experiences with the Army, which is why I decided to make it two different colors. Â  Like all things in life, you have to take in the good along with the bad - that's just life, right? Â  The coins placed over these two colors are part of the \u0026quot;military life\u0026quot; and bring the two colors together as a whole. Â  I don't think the cat and the dog need explaining. ðŸ™‚\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole process took about three days - with work being done during nap time and a little after dark as well. Â  The fun thing about this project was learning how to work with wood. Â  I started watching wood working podcasts with the hope that I would take up woodworking as a hobby. Â  Without some of the podcasts and blogs, like \u003ca href=\"http://thewoodwhisperer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eThe Wood Whisperer\u003c/a\u003e, I would not have even known where to start. Â  I was able to walk into the garage and things just started coming together. Â  I figured out how to use the tools like the chisels, the Dremel, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I was getting Izzy ready, I looked at the display sitting on the counter and thought, \u0026quot;Holy crap. Â  \u003cem\u003eI made that!\u003c/em\u003e\u0026quot; Â  It is a wonderful feeling to create something all on your own, especially for a notorious computer nerd like myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm inspired to work more with wood and create more crazy stuff. Â  For now, this wave of inspiration and creativity has passed, and I did say these waves are far apart, so who knows when my next project will be. ðŸ˜‰\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't forget to check out the \u003ca href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eFlickr set\u003c/a\u003e for the entire collection of photos I took while making the display.\u003c/p\u003e"

        <p>Last week Ciriana told me that her Sergeant was going to give Ciriana a &quot;good-bye&quot; luncheon. Â  Although Ciri's official last day isn't until May, her last day in the clinic is nigh. Â  Her Sergeant asked me to send her pictures of Ciriana in a bite suit from a re-enlistment ceremony in Germany. Â  The photo was mounted onto a plaque that Ciriana received during the luncheon - it is pretty awesome looking.</p>
<p>When her Sergeant told me what she was going to do with the pictures, I didn't think about getting Ciriana anything just from me, except maybe some flowers. Â  That is, Â  until Sunday afternoon. Â  Remember that episode of Scrubs with the &quot;epiphany toilet?&quot; Â  Well, I get epiphany's in the bathroom too, only mine are in the shower. Â  So, there I am lathering, rinsing, and repeating, when it hits me. Â  Ciriana wanted a coin display for her challenge coins. Â  All of the ones I've seen are either ugly or just blah. Â  So... &quot;Why not design and make one myself,&quot; I thought as I scrubbed my nether regions.</p>
<p>My creativity is weird. Â  It comes in waves... BIG spread out waves. Â  Once I get an idea, my creativity goes into overdrive. Â  I could do it this way, or I could do it that way... oh! It would be so cool... etc. etc. Â  It wasn't until Monday that I finally had a pretty good sketch of what I was going to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Final Display" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3350680194_10b3da055e.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Everything about the display means something. Â  Ciriana and I have an equal amount of good and bad experiences with the Army, which is why I decided to make it two different colors. Â  Like all things in life, you have to take in the good along with the bad - that's just life, right?

Â  I was able to walk into the garage and things just started coming together. Â  I figured out how to use the tools like the chisels, the Dremel, and more.</p>

<p>I'm inspired to work more with wood and create more crazy stuff. Â  For now, this wave of inspiration and creativity has passed, and I did say these waves are far apart, so who knows when my next project will be. ðŸ˜‰</p>
