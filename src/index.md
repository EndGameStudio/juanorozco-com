**Wonderer, explorer, creator.**

-Juan


I am a **web applications engineer** working in Raleigh, North Carolina. Originally from Ventura, California, I carry the ocean in my soul; my style is laid back but passionate.

I'm a self proclaimed anthropologist, writer, and photographer. I make RL things as well as web things. I suppose if you need more I could also add husband, father, mild foodie, architecture appreciator, and tinkerer.

Put simply, though, I am a <span class="motto">wonderer, explorer, and creator</span>.

## Social

You can find me being social in the usual nerdy places. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/guamaso), [Github](https://github.com/Guamaso), [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Guamaso/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/juanthedesigner/). I try to stick to the handle **@guamaso**.

## Writing

I also do a little bit of writing...

<ul id="publishings">
	<li><a href="http://dev.endgamestudio.com">Dev Journal</a> - I log my thoughts on web development and also chronicle my growth as an engineer.</li>
	<li><a href="http://exitzaero.com">ExitZaero</a> - Gaming and games.</li>
	<li><a href="http://creativeandflow.com">Creative and Flow</a> - A magazine about creativity, exploration, wonder, and failure.</li>
</ul>

## More...

I try to keep my <a href="http://about.me/juanorozco">about.me</a> page fairly current.
