[HipstaMart » Prints Pricing][1].

I don't think many of my hipstashots are that great, but on a personal level, I like a lot of them.  I love giving photographs to family as gifts, too.

If Hipstamatic is as dedicated to the quality of the prints as they are to the app and the services they already provide, I'm sure the prints will be great. I can't wait to get my first set.
