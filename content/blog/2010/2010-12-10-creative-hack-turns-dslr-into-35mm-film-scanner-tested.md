</p>&nbsp;</a>This sounds like it would be more complicated than it's worth, but then again, a newer DSLR with a large CCD could output better results than a store bought film scanner.  There's going to be a lot of tweaking and dialing in before the results are at least _good_.  The hardest part, though, isn't the alignment or lens settings - it's going to be the lighting.  More research is needed before I try this out. I do want to try this out, though.[Creative Hack Turns DSLR into 35mm Film Scanner - Tested][1].
