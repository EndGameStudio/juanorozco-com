How do you learn from mistakes? How do you see challenges? How do you take critique?

I've been wondering and theorizing about my own ability to self-analyze. I assume most people feel the same way towards self and others, that we all want success and happiness. Whatever that means to you.

Yet, what I see, sometimes, is a sort of slow self-destruction through stagnation or through arrogance. Do we see failure as being easier than change? Change _is_ hard, but remaining static is deadly.

Iâ€™ve been there. I have failed HARD. I took a step back, looked at how my actions got me there and thought critically what I could have done differently.

Sometimes, I did mostly everything right with the knowledge I had at the time. Sometimes I could have sought more knowledge. Sometimes, I could have been more proactive. Regardless, in every case, there were opportunities for growth; for change. 

The really big failures caused the most stress and the most change. But also resulted in the most opportunities for happiness.

I'm not offering an answer here, just the question: **Is change really worth giving up being happier?**
