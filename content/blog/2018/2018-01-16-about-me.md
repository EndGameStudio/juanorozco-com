I am a **web applications engineer** working in Raleigh, North Carolina. Originally from Ventura, California, I carry the ocean in my soul; my style is laid back but passionate.

I love photography, writing, and making things. I suppose if you need more I could also add husband, father, mild foodie, architecture appreciator, and tinkerer.

Put simply, though, I am a <span class="motto">wonderer, explorer, and creator</span>.

## Social {#social}

  * [Twitter][1]
  * [LinkedIn][2]
  * [Github][3]
  * [npm][4]
  * [500px][5]
  * [Instagram][6]
  * [Flickr][7](Don't really use this anymore...)

## Code {#code}

I publish a few things on [Github][3] and on [npm][4]. I appreciate any feedback you can provide!

## Writing {#writing}

I also do a little bit of writing...

  * [ExitZaero][8] - Gaming and games.
  * [Creative and Flow][9] - A magazine about creativity, exploration, wonder, and failure.

## More... {#more}

I try to keep my [about.me][10] page fairly current.
