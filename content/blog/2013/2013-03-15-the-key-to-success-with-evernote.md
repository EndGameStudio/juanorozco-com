I've switched organization styles numerous times with my notes over the years.  Through every change, though, only the search engine maintains my sanity.

Knowing how it works is important, but you can get by with basic understanding of search concepts.  For people wanting to make Evernote "work" for them or for people like me (fanboy to the core) who just want to learn how to use searching more efficiently, reading the Evernote Search doc is key to success.
