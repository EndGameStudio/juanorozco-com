I love workspaces. I like finding new configurations and new items for my desk or work area.  The Radio Ball is such a brilliant idea that can be used for many different purposes.  Games, discovery, and more.  The one I am focused on is desk radio.  It's the not so glamorous desk ornament turned hip and cool.  Just rotate until you find your station then rotate along the new axis to control volume (at least that's what I gathered from the video).  Love it.  Perhaps a digital (mp3 player) version in the future?
