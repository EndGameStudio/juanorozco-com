When I wake up early to get a jump on work, one of my favorite moments is when my monitor’s brightness changes as the sun comes up.&#160; 

I have [F.Lux][1] installed because I do a lot of stuff either really late or really early.&#160; When F.Lux brightens my screen in the morning, it’s almost like a happy cup of coffee; like watching the sun come up but not knowing you were waiting for it.&#160;
