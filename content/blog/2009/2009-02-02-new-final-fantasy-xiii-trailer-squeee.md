You all know I am a BIG FF fan.   I want FFXIII NOW!   Sigh.   Until the game comes out, I'm stuck drooling over whatever teaser video the big S can give me.   Like the one they <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/ff13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just released</a>.   Can't embed the video so follow the link to SquareEnix's FFXIII site.

I also want to say that the franchise has come a long way.   In game battles are \*awesome\*

P.S. The link above was really choppy on my computer, but <a href="http://www.square-enix.co.jp/fabula/ff13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one isn't</a> for some reason.   Although, it doesn't have subtitles in it.
