* **Front End Engineer at** [**Aquilio**](https://aquil.io/ "Work with us!"): We are continuing to work through a pivot due to covid-19 challenges. I'm really proud of the team this last few weeks. We've really pulled together to make sure the company makes it through the current crisis. 
* **COVID-19:** We are extremely blessed. We are all healthy, I can still work, and I can, therefore, continue paying my bills. We're doing our best to support local businesses and to help where we can and encouraging others to consider the effects of returning to pre-covid life. Please, **stay home** as much as possible.
* **Investing**: I recently became interested in the stock market. I quickly learned that it takes a LOT of research to manage a portfolio. I want to read a few books about this but I think I learned all that I care to. Basically, for me, a Roth IRA with some automatic investments is perfectly fine and that's where I think I'm going to leave that.
* **Family D&D:** My oldest has been wanting to get into D&D. I played it a few times but I've never DM'd. Luckily, Wizards makes a [nice beginner's box](https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/4386/essentials-kit-deluxe-edition) that has pretty much everything we needed to start our campaign. I'm just soaking up everything I can about delivering a good experience as a new DM. I think it's going well so far. :)
