* **Front End Engineer at Aquilio**: React Hooks are amazing but still find myself wrapping my mind around the possibilities of hooks in components. I'm really proud of the team this last few weeks. We've really pulled together to make sure the company makes it through the current crisis. I'm hopeful we'll make it through this.
* **COVID-19:** Doing OK, my guess is we are doing better than most. I am extremely blessed that we are all healthy, I can still work, that I still have a job, and I can, therefore, continue paying my bills. We're doing our best to support local businesses and to help where we can (wifey made a ton of masks, for example). Please, **stay home** as much as possible. Do what you can but remember, **this is real**.
* **Investing**: Started learning about investing. What a crazy time to start. Not that I can do too much with investing but it's the interest I have right now. Pun not intended but kinda wish it was.
