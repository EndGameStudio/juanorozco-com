* **Front End Engineer at** [**Aquilio**](https://aquil.io/ "Work with us!"): Even with COVID budgets being limited, we're doing well. We've got some really interesting projects on deck. There's work to do to come out of the other side but it's going to be hard work.
* **COVID-19:** We're doing our part to encourage a changed mindset during this COVID pandemic. Wearing masks, avoiding large gatherings - for the most part we avoid most gatherings. Trying to promote small and local businesses as best we can.
* **Family D&D:** DMing our family game is something I never realized I needed in my life. Sure, all the tropes of DMing players are true. But I am enjoying the story-telling and world-building possibilities.
