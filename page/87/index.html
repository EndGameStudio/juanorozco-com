        <p>It's wishlist time. Last year was a pretty successful year for my annual personal holiday, I got Mario Kart, my sub-woofer, and a few other doo-dads. This year is a tough one for many people including my family and friends. I never expect gifts from them but they always ask what I want. It's also fun to just list the things I am excited about.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1703" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1703" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1703" title="protocd100" src="https://i2.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/protocd100-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="Protomen" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1703" class="wp-caption-text">Protomen</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of my biggest things this year is creativity and art focused around the things I grew up around: video games, puzzles, and toys. One of my favorite art forms to indulge myself with is music. Lately, when I am on my computer, I'll be listening to Last.FM's video game channel. I discovered an awesome band called <a href="http://www.protomen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Protomen</a>. They're widely popular right now - and rightly so - their music is based on the Mega Man universe and has a real dark apocalyptic tone to it. Beautiful music. <a href="http://www.zambooie.com/stores/Detail.tpl?cart=12412698193666992&st_id=236&sku=PROTOCD100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Me want</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to return to my electrical-geek days by making my own USB powered LED lights. I bought a big bag of random LED's off of eBay some time ago thinking my parents still had my electronics toolkit that I left behind. Nope. My Dad must of taken it years ago. The only thing I really need right now is a <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B0002ZPU6C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breadboard</a>. I'd love to get a new soldering iron, a bag of random resistors, and some perfboard... but that's for later.</p>
<p>While I am on the subject of electronics, I have been itching to play with one of those <a href="http://www.robotshop.us/arduino-usb-microcontroller-board.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arduino boards</a>. I like the LED email alert widget that can sit on a desk. I long time ago, I wanted to make a unit that attaches to the trash can that will send me a text message when the trash can is not on the street Monday night. It's an expensive idea that really outweighs any benefit I get from it, but that's how this geek rolls!</p>
<figure id="attachment_1705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1705" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1705" title="ventura" src="https://i0.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/ventura-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="ventura" width="150" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1705" class="wp-caption-text">Ventura County Photgraphy</figcaption></figure>
<p>I have enjoyed photography for decades. I can't even say when I really started to love it - that's how far back it goes. I never took classes on photography, instead I learned and gained inspiration through the works of others. I bought photography books left and right. Today, I am doing the same with drawing and art. I'll take any good books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=photography&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photography</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=watercolor&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watercoloring</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=pencil+sketching&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pencil sketching</a>... anything. Books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=graphic+design&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graphic design</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=typography&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typography</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=web+design&x=0&y=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web design</a>, and pretty much anything design is also on my list. I'm absorbing knowledge like a friggin' Sham-Wow right now.</p>
<p>The last thing on my list are gift cards, specifically for downloadable content. I am really into the iPhone apps and WiiWare downloads, more-so than buying actual games at the store right now.  I think <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/giftcards/itunes/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iTunes gift cards</a> work with the app store and <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000IMYL0U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wii Points cards</a> are everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be good this year. Ciri says it's really hard to shop for me because everything I want is <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/07/22/e3-is-over-and-i-want-an-xbox-360">very</a> <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/06/24/sennheisers-freaking-rock">expensive.</a> As you can see, not one gift passes the $50 mark!  Yay me!</p>

        <p>It was my brother's birthday a few days ago and I didn't get him anything. I have a good reason though! This year, I am trying to give everyone art - I need the practice :P. For Ciri, you can see the inspiration <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3403674335/">comes</a> <a href="http://guamaso.com/2009/03/12/custom-challenge-coin-display-gift">somewhat</a> <a href="http://guamaso.com/2009/04/01/the-happy-plant">easily</a>. The last time I spent time with Bobby was probably about 6 or so years ago. The two of us have our little families and only visiting California twice in the past 5 years doesn't help either. It is understandable that inspiration for his gift was scarce. Until last Thursday night, that is.</p>
<p>Brian, the sole writer/choreographer/designer at <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MorningToast.com</a>, was hosting his weekly radio show, <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/caveradio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cave Radio </a><a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/caveradio/2009/04/423-replay-scavenger-hunt/">Thursday night</a>.  When the conversation turned to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, he played the original theme song from the cartoon. After the show I started reminiscing about all the times Bobby and I sat in front of the TV; following along the adventures of the Ninja Turtles. Those were simpler times - <em>beautiful</em> and simple times.   They were beautiful because Bobby and I don't share too many interests, but the turtles on Saturday mornings were the richest memories I have of Bobby.  So that was it, I decided that I would make something that related to those memories of our childhood.</p>
<p>Bobby's favorite turtle was and always will be, Leo - the strong and honorable leader.  Naturally I would have to center my art around Leo, and that's when the image formed in my mind. I sketched for a few hours and finally got something good enough to scan into photoshop and start coloring in.</p>
<p>While I was doing this, I thought it would be a cool idea to broadcast myself on UStream. So, I set up my computer and announced it to my friends and family on Facebook. I experienced a few problems (bad audio was the biggest issue) but I got a good forty-somewhat minutes of video in there. Next event coming up is Mother's day, so maybe I'll do this again.  It was good geeky fun.</p>
<p>The final drawing came out really cool.  I'm still learning drawing techniques and skills but the end product came out pretty good.  It's a simple image and yet I know Bobby will appreciate it a lot.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1691" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1691" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img class="size-medium wp-image-1691" title="Leo Final Sketch" src="https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/leo-sketch-final-copy-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Leo - Final" width="225" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-1691" class="wp-caption-text">Leo - Final</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bobby doesn't read my journal, by the way, just in case you were wondering. Ciri questioned my unsecretiveness after she noticed that I was publishing this post.</p>

        <p>I like digital photo frames, especially the DIY bunch.  Why buy one when you can make one way cooler - on the cheap?</p>
<p>I am still working on turning my old iBook into one, but with my limited experience of Linux and it's command line interface, it's taking longer than I thought.</p>
<figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="iPhone Frame" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3388135368_bb1a47ed1e_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="iPhone Frame" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">iPhone Frame</figcaption></figure>
<p>Previous to the GameBoy DSi announcement, I contemplated turning my SP into a digital frame as well.  But the SP is the last gameboy to play original Gameboy games and advance Gameboy games, so that guy is staying in one piece.</p>
<p>While I finish getting the software ready on the iBook, I thought about converting a small frame into a fancy dock for my iPhone.  I was playing a slideshow of Izzy's antics to Ciri earlier this week on my iPhone when the idea came to me.</p>
<p>As with the iBook, before taking anything apart, I needed to make sure the software would cooperate.  Luckily, the app store has a few choices when it comes to slideshow applications.</p>
<p>The frame itself is pretty straight forward, and cheap.  All I needed was:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone (or Touch) with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=293125183&mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhotoFrame</a> application - there's a few choices, but PhotoFrame is free 😀</li>
<li>cardboard (after a trip to Ikea, we have tons)</li>
<li>school glue</li>
<li>an unused frame</li>
<li>paint (if you want to paint it)</li>
<li>small amount of matting (but I guess you could use construction paper, too)</li>
<li>a few screws (to screw the back part down, duh.)</li>
<li>a handy box cutter (a cutting mat would help too, or a lot of scrap cardboard)</li>
<li>and of course, a screwdriver (a drill is funner, though.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step was to cut the matting to size.  Remember to measure twice and stuff.</p>
<figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="holderforiphone" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3387414567_b955c0855f_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="iPhone pocket and matting" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">iPhone pocket and matting</figcaption></figure>
<p>The frame I used was a little deep, so I laid some slices of cardboard below the mat.  This way, the mat would get pressed against the glass instead of wiggling around.  Then, I cut more slices of card board in a sort of L shape to fit around the phone.  Next, I glued it all together, making sure that the slices were aligned.</p>
<p>While the glue dried, I took the frame into the garage and gave it a good coat of spray paint.  I wanted to use a black paint to bring out the image, but all I had on hand was primer gray and a hammered finished metallic paint.  I didn't feel like packing up the kid and drive to Lowe's, so I used the hammered finish stuff.  Anyway, one good coat, then another a few hours later.  It was dry by the next day and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3388221446/in/set-72157615939909968/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looked pretty good</a>.</p>
<p>The &quot;pocket&quot; should be ready by the next day, too.  Although, the glue I used constricted the cardboard a bit after it dried - I should have left something inside the pocket to push against the cardboard.  Oh well.</p>
<p>I aligned the pocket into the frame and screwed it down with the wood screws, and viola!  iPhone Frame!  Just be careful not to drive the screws all the way through. DOH!  Yea, I thought the screws weren't long enough, but they were. &gt;:(</p>
<p>The app on the iPhone will download 10 pictures to the phone (I think it's 10) and then loop between them.  You can set it so it displays photos from either the public photostream or your photostream.  There's other software on the app store that have more options, but most of them aren't free (some are just a buck, that's not too bad. 😛  ) and many don't support Flickr.</p>
<p>A future upgrade will be to create some sort of ejecting mechanism for it.  As it is, I have to turn the frame upside down or pull on the cord to get it out.  In the near future, I'm going to drill some holes in the back for ventilation - it gets a little warm when connected.</p>
<p>It's also not very convenient when the phone rings (a bluetooth headset would solve this problem.), but it still <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/3388134920/in/set-72157615939909968/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks really cool on my shelf.</a></p>
