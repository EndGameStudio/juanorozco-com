        <p>As the resident stay at home parent, I am now in charge of many house duties.   Fixing the bed?   Me.   Cleaning? Always has been me.   Animal caretaker?   Me.   Cooking?   Me.   (I'm so gonna get hell for that second one.)   I don't mind these responsibilities, as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of them.   Especially cooking.   I'm not sure what it is, probably something to do with my geekyness, but I have so much fun creating meals from ingredients.</p>
<figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="Rocky Road Cookie" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3182/2979623973_35c97060cf_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rocky Road Cookie</figcaption></figure>
<p>I do have to admit that cooking over a stove is an animal, but baking is a true beast!   Some would say the stove is a bit more difficult, but I say the oven is unforgiving.</p>
<p>I am starting with easy recipes.   A couple of weeks ago I tried some cookies by using a cake mix.   The recipe was on the box and I kick myself for not copying it down.   The cookies turned out great, a little overcooked - which is why I said &quot;unforgiving&quot; - but still yummy.   I could have used the recipe today, but since I didn't keep it, I had to result to the internet.</p>
<p>I found a recipe that sounded about right and went to work.   First I made a batch without <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mushrooms</span> marshmallows since Ciri doesn't care for them. Side note: I must have some sort of dyslexia because everytime I want to say marshmallows, I say mushrooms instead.   It also seems to extend into my typing.   Not good.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the first batch came out a bit cakey; very soft.   I followed the recipe, but for some reason the cookies came out like cookie-shaped cake.   Although, after they had time to cool down, they did harden a bit.</p>
<p>My second batch included the marshmallows.   This is where I say the oven is unforgiving.   The mallows overcooked, lost too much moisture and became rock hard.   I tried to cook them longer so that they would come out like cookies and not cake.</p>
<p>Afterward, I met with my personal chef trainer - the wife.   She advised me that I should try heavy cream instead of milk and maybe use two eggs instead of one.   I made them for her so we could have a <a href="http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/desserts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizookie</a> for desert tonight and I am just glad they were edible.</p>
<p>My next baking attempt will be homemade granola.   Stay tuned for that disaster.   *snicker*   I need to give myself more credit.   Oy.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe, be warned: they may come out like cake-ookies.   I got it from Cooks dot com.</p>
<p>1 pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
<p>1 stick butter, softened</p>
<p>1/2 c. walnuts or pecans</p>
<p>1/2 c. oatmeal</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>1/3 c. milk</p>
<p>1 (2 layer size) cake mix, white for reg. cookies or chocolate for chocolate chocolate chip.</p>
<p>Get the <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,186,159189-234199,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rest of it at cooks dot com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I had some cookies yesterday from this batch and they were exceptional.   I take everything bad back about this recipe- it doesn't need to be changed.   I do remember having to cook them a little longer though.   Marshmallows are still a No-go.</p>

        <figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="The Bullies Are Warming Up" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/74/200168854_23f87a741d_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="Flickr User: Mangee" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Flickr User: Mangee</figcaption></figure>
<p>A new web 2.0-esque website offers a messaging service for schools that allow students and parents to send in alerts of possible bully problems.   Students or parents can go online and send out an email (or text message) to their school authorities explaining their situation.   The system requires registration, but the message is anonymous - which sounds like a flaw to me since we're dealing with adolescents here.   It's a great idea right?   Ever heard of &quot;treating the symptom?&quot;</p>
<p>I detest bullies. That said, some of my own childhood bullies turned out to be ok-ish human beings.   Becoming a bully seems to be the way of life for children that grow up in some pretty nasty family situations.   They turn out to be fairly upstanding citizens later in life and I'm sure they look back and feel remorse for the things they did.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some children have some tough lives but never turn to that life of bully-hood.   My best friend lost his father at a very young age.   Today, he cherishes every moment he spends with his own son, and works hard to provide for him.   He's not a bully, he's not a vagrant, he has not one malicious bone in his body.   Ok.   Maybe one.   Like a femur or something.   The point is, bullies are a product of different things: their environment, their family, and their own thoughts.   Ultimately, they all have the ability to rationalize and make their own decisions.   Either way you look at it, they need guidance.   Is this the guidance they need?</p>
<p>I grew up with a couple of bad apples on my block.   I dealt with them and life moved on.   My daughter will experience them one day and I fear for her mental safety like any parent, but instead of taking this cloak and dagger route to alleviate my fears, Ciri and I will teach Izzy how to respond and react to oppression.   Her mom is a U.S. Soldier for crying out loud - &quot;suck it up&quot; as they say.   The problem is not the bully, it's what causes bullies to exist in the first place: bad parenting.   And bad parenting isn't nullified by more bad parenting.</p>
<p>I am not condemning the software that the schools are using, just the reason behind its use.   The site really pushes its services for the right reasons.   They allow students to send in anonymous reports of illegal activity like drug use and other crimes.   I can get behind something like that.   As adults we have the ability to report suspicious activity.   Then again, as adults, where do I go to complain about my neighbor picking on me?   Exactly.   You deal with it on <em>your own</em>.   How can we expect our children to deal with their problems as adults when we allow them to escape problems during their youth?</p>
<p>I know some bullies can be especially malicious, and in these cases the software will prove valuable.   My point is not that the service shouldn't be used to report bullies, it is that parents are getting lazy.   You give them the chance to stop being a parent and they will take it.   I wrote about <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/03/18/a-long-post-about-video-games">parents blaming violence on video games</a> before, and it's a great example of what I am talking about.   Parents will take the easy way out by blaming someone else.   In this case, they let their children send in an anonymous comment on a situation that could have been solved by other means.   Because of this parenting method, the software will become so abused that its purpose will become vague and, eventually, ineffective.</p>
<p>The company's website has an example of the software's use.   One student is reporting that two other students are going to fight after school.   In this case, let's assume the student did what he could to stop the fight.   Great parenting, right?   He analyzed the situation and utilized the tools he had available to him.   The school is better off because it made the service available to the students.</p>
<p>The website advertises more situations like this where the students don't have any other means of solving the problem.   The situations depicted on the site are great examples of the service's use.   But I think schools are acquiring the service because of anti-bully laws, not because of the admirable goals of the service provider.</p>
<p>The web service that this new technology offers is a <em>great idea.</em> I think it can help many students with <em>serious</em> problems.   Schools benefit greatly from it by the positive impact it has on school morale.   Still, parents must take the right steps before they use the service by appropriately analyzing the situation and taking the appropriate action.   If the service really is the most prudent way to handle the situation, then great, but it shouldn't be the immediate answer.   Bullies can be annoying, but they may need just as much help as the &quot;victim&quot; does.</p>

<p>I was browsing my feeds before I hit the hay and I see in big bright letters, &quot;Nintendo Announces Nintendo DSi!&quot;</p>
<p>I've been following the Nintendo forums and blogs, many of them full of rumors and talk over a redesign/update to the DS.   The DS Fanboy blog is full of great info and they just <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2008/10/02/nintendo-announces-nintendo-dsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped this bomb a few hours ago</a>.</p>
<p>There is a conference in Japan this week where Nintendo is releasing this info to the public, called Nintendo Media Summit.   DS Fanboy was invited to the event and posted today's events.   IGN is also on hand at the event, and were <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/915/915504p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live blogging the conference</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite feature is the enhanced displays; three and a quarter inches of video game love!   The new DS also sports TWO digital cameras (external and internal), SD slot, on-board memory, and much much more!   Oh yeah, the new DS doesn't have a GBA slot, so no more Game Boy Advanced games.   Good thing I still have my SP!</p>
<p>Price point sounds like it will be about $180 this November (in Japan...).   I can't wait to trade my DS in for this bad boy. Hmm. Sounds like a new addition to my wishlist!</p>
<p>Another great update from the summit is actually for the Wii.   The Wii will soon be able to load software directly from the SD card.   The down side: maximum memory for the SD slot is 2 GBs.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on DS Fanboy, Wii Fanboy, and IGN for more info!   Also, check out the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese site for the DSi</a>!</p>
