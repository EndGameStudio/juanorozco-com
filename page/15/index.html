        <p>Before <a href="fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> became a thing in my world, I used these awesome wire bound notebooks I bought a long time ago from the community college bookstore. I loved the green tint of the paper and the thick covers. Alas, it is impossible to stack wire bound notebooks neatly.</p>
<p>Now, in the &quot;Field Notes Era&quot;, the smaller page count causes me to go through notebooks faster. Also, I keep reference pages in the back that I need to copy over (or tear out) with every notebook change.</p>
<p>This is a problem. One that should be easily remedied either with a better process or with discipline. But, like all problems, I really need to explore the possibilities first. One thing I hear a lot about are index cards.</p>
<h2>Ubiquity in 3 by 5 form {#ubiquityin3by5form}</h2>
<p>Some <em>really</em> smart people advocate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA">Hipster PDA</a> approach and rely solely on index cards.</p>
<p>Look... Index cards are boring to me. No, not the process, but the paper itself. The paper is usually a three by five cut of bright white paper printed with lightish blue tinted lines. Booooring.</p>
<p>Unlike the Field Notes, there is no joy in writing on an index card. Sure, there's not much to innovate on with an index card - it's hard to innovate on the details when index cards lack, well... <em>details</em>. Then again, index cards' modular and mobile characteristics are desirable. Desirable enough to give them a solid try.</p>
<h2>Commit! {#commit}</h2>
<p>I bought a cheap-o pack of index cards at Walmart. I suppose that was a mistake. I <em>should</em> have bought a nicer pack from a brand that cares about paper and the experience of writing. This is an experiment, a $3.00 experiment so far, and I can always donate them to the kids' crafting supplies.</p>
<p>It may not come to that, though. Well, the batch I bought will <strong>probably</strong> get donated regardless - that's how bad the paper is. But, the integration of index cards into my workflow is turning out well.</p>
<p>Here's what I have discovered works for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes that I need to shared with someone (like the wife, for example) go on an index card.</li>
<li>Reference notes (like server IP's) go on an index card.</li>
<li>Everything else goes in the notebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm experimenting with keeping To Do's on the index card as well. It feels good to be able to trash the index card once the list is complete. Although, sometimes, the card may not be completed for several months - that's just how that list will go.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Jul/2014-07-25-22-37-03-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This whole modification, though, is going well. We'll see how it continues.</p>

        <p>It takes years to develop and refine a skill. It takes longer still to fix a character flaw or improve a virtue. People have proven that, with proper focus, you can turn your life around. The goal is not to change but to build discipline or values that didn't exist, or barely existed, before.</p>
<p><strong>Current thought...</strong></p>
<p>Intense focus on something new for one year. Immerse yourself in that thing totally. Live it. Breathe it. Allow it to consume you... then drop it after a year and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Visualize that next year of your life with a singular goal: master this new thing. Living that year without this new thing would mean death to you. It is just one thing but it is the <em>only</em> thing.</p>
<p>What effects could this have on how you think? Or how you react to situations? The &quot;thing&quot; can be anything. Sewing, living in a foreign country, hermitic life, underground street fighting - something opposite to who you are or something scary.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I wonder how much improvement we would see in ourselves with pure and complete focus.</p>

        <p>The idea of walking from one room to another, talking to your family over the phone, but not tied to a device in any way. The caller's voice travels with you to each room through speakers built into the wall. Presence sensors in each room detect your movement between rooms. A sensitive microphone also embedded in each room, but processed and cleaned up by a fancy computer somewhere in the house (so your voice doesn't sound &quot;far away&quot;.)... <em>this</em> is the future I remember being told was in store for us. Un-tethered and automated; <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>Privacy concerns have arisen, in the past few years, with recent breaches and reports. Do I really want a company to collect personal data and sell it to someone else? All under the premise that it will help automate my world? I don't think I do... but I really, <strong>really</strong> want that automated part!</p>
<p>I won't get much more into the privacy conversation than to just acknowledge that it is a <em>thing</em> that society as a whole needs to make a decision on.</p>
<p>Data is a required part of automating. Computers are dumb - take it from me, I have to program them. The more data we have on the way people use a thing, the more accurate and useful a computer can be assisting with the use of that thing.</p>
<h2>Low Hanging Fruit {#lowhangingfruit}</h2>
<p>The goal, for me, is to automate the silly parts of owning a home. Maintenance and purchasing are probably the low hanging fruit. Not to mention all the current products out there that handle big things well, like Nest or Nest's line of fire alarms. Still, those are pretty pricey. I'm thinking about things like HVAC filters, the fridge water filters, more dish washing soap, shoes for the kids (they don't stop growing!), coffee, coconut cream, mulch for the planters... I can keep going. All these items we order consistently and regularly.</p>
<p>Again, what we need here is data. How often do you run out of stuff? What life events may cause the average to change? Until companies open up the data you create with your shopping trips, only the companies themselves will be able to support this kind of experience which means they will only provide the experience if you shop at their store. Makes sense; they have to thrive, too.</p>
<p>So, no data then. What can we without data? Well, can we at least automate the purchasing part?! Amazon doesn't <em>really</em> allow this but then there are services like <a href="http://zinc.io">Zinc.io</a> that work with business to automate purchases so it <em>is</em> possible. Sweet. All we need to do is to <em>do</em> it.</p>
<p>This is a long ways away from walking around my house with true hands-free and voice activated automation - it <em>is</em> a start.</p>
<h2>It's a good time to be a nerd {#itsagoodtimetobeanerd}</h2>
<p>The greatest part of the Internet-of-Things/home automation mindset is that it hit a golden age of interest and output. More and more companies are wrapping their little capitalist fingers around the idea and pumping out useful (sometimes) products. Uber-nerds, like myself, are smitten with products like Raspberry Pi, Beagleboard, and Arduino. These little &quot;Maker&quot; specials are <strong>wondrous</strong> tools of mass nerdiness. My point is, if I was trying to make one, home automation is BACK! 😀</p>
<p>Here's a great example of the kind of experiences I am talking about:</p>
