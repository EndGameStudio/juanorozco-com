        <p>In the beginning, a few years back, when I first started designing web sites, I designed sites on what I thought looked good. After they were built, I realized that they looked like crap. They layout, the color, the content, and the usability. As I progressed, I learned more and more even though I didn't completely know or understand the theories and practices behind web design. Now, as my designs' quality increase, I feel like in order to really fine tune everything, I need to know and understand every aspect of every theory involving design.</p>
<figure id="attachment_298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-298" style="width: 152px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-298" title="colormanual" src="https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/colormanual.gif?resize=152%2C168" alt="Desinger Color Manual" width="152" height="168" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-298" class="wp-caption-text">Designer's Color Manual</figcaption></figure>
<p>My first query into the theories is about color theory. This is one of my favorite and toughest subjects. Every child learns colors in school and they learn what color is what; green is for the grass, blue is the sky and ocean, orange is the sun etc.. But what they don't learn is the theory behind all these visible colors, like red, green, and blue are the primary colors of light. Even though we were all taught it was red, blue and yellow. I could go on forever about it and not make any sense... so rather then seem like an illiterate fool, I am just going to talk about this book: Designer's Color Manual.</p>
<p>It's pretty... with all the colors and pictures. Seriously, it is really well laid out, images and diagrams to explain the different concepts and ideas. There is a lot of information that a self taught designer should know and for me, it will help with designing our landscape too... silly reason to enjoy a book, but I am beginning to enjoy landscape design too now. I was afraid of putting together a mish-mash of colors in our yard, so now I am learning about color theory and soon I will be able to design a better web page and maybe even a landscape, since color is what we all recognize before text, right?</p>

        <p>Ciriana says that I turned her on to Linkin Park on our first date. At first I didn't really like them until I listened to the lyrics. My problem with music is that all I can hear is the melody; I can never distinguish the words. I liked the musical parts of their songs, but the words I did hear kind of kept me at a distance. When I finally focused my attention on what they were saying I enjoyed the music more. It also taught me a very important life lesson, as corny as this sounds: never pass judgment until you have all the information. I said to others that they were a stupid band and that it's not music, but when I actually listened, I realized that I had assumed that their &quot;sound&quot; was destructive.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, now they are one of my favorite bands, and Ciri really likes them too. We went out and bought the CD a couple of weeks ago and I use it to get me going in the morning. Ciriana is gone by the time I have to get up and I am not an early person, so I need music (I don't do coffee). I have my computer streaming music to my Wii via Jinzora, so I can listen to all my music from downstairs. I have my little playlist of songs for the morning and Minutes to Midnight is one of the first albums on there.</p>
<p>Yea, so I just wanted to say that I like the new CD.</p>
