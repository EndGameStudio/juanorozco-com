<p>Here I am, sitting at my computer again, virtual-window shopping. Â  I'm staring at the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion for World of Warcraft</a> like some little kid hoping that an onlooker will feel bad for me and buy it for me. Â  Damn online shopping...</p>
<p>Seriously, I would like to get my hands on a copy, but I am in no hurry. Â  I play the game for the story and the adventure - which is a nice way of saying I am not level 70 yet. Â  I started playing around April of last year and my main character, <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Sisters+of+Elune&n=Odiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odium, is currently at level 47</a>. Â  I have two or three characters in the mid thirties as well, but none of them are as fun, to me, as my Rogue (hence, RogueDad. Â  Sneaky sneaky). Â  I would be level 70 by now, but I have other commitments in life, that and I am slow...</p>
<p>So because I am such a low level, I can't take part in much of the new content. Â  Although, the recent patch introduced enough content and features to keep me happy.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, though, I logged in last night to see how the world was doing and I was really hoping to catch my first glimpse at the new class, the Death Knights. Â  I got on the zeppelin to Kalimdor and there's a crazy lookin' blood elf on her mount standing at the front, all dressed in black. Â  &quot;Gasp&quot; and &quot;Rawr!&quot; Â  Death Knights are <em>awe-some</em> (especially female blood elves)!</p>
<p>The new patch and expansion introduced some new elements to the storyline as well as tons of other cool stuff, so I am really excited to see how this whole &quot;war against the Burning Legion&quot; turns out. Â  Until I reach level 70 and our finances pick up again, Wrath of the Lich King will have to wait. Â  That is, unless, someone would like to <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000VJTJNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor me... ðŸ˜‰<br /> </a></p>

<p>It's been a while since I visited Lego.com, or any Lego related website, for that matter. Â  I subscribe to Lego magazine and I will occasionally browse over to the Lego blogs via other blogs.</p>
<p>I'm not into building Legos like I was as a child, or even in High School (<strong>Geek-cred</strong>: I did a presentation in class with my Lego models as a visual aid) but that doesn't mean they don't have a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I remember the days of Lego City and Octane and Space and the first years of the Technic line. Â  Now, there's Star Wars and Batman and Indiana Jones and anime inspired minifigs and so much more. Â  I can't wait for the day when I hand Izzy-monster her first <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000NO9GT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue bin</a>. Â  But that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Last week I got a holiday shopping catalog and it had all the new sets that the Lego-sphere has been going crazy with. Â  The Taj Mahal, for example, is the largest set (piece count) in Lego history and is especially popular with the Lego bloggers.</p>
<p>One item that got my attention was the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stormtrooper minifig key chain</a>. Â  Since I don't build anymore, I only read about Lego's for sentimental reasons. Â  When I saw the line of key chains, I thought they would be perfect for the retired Lego builder- dangling off a key chain as a reminder of the good ol' days where imagination and inspiration ran free. Â  Sigh. Â  Yup. Â  Simpler times.... Â  Aaanyyway, don't get me goin' down that route...</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that these little dudes are a sign of every geek's past and make a perfect &quot;whenever&quot; gift for either the retired Lego-ist, or the active builders. Â  It's a gift that really does say &quot;I love my geek.&quot; Â  I will add this little guy to my wishlist in case anybody feels the need to say... well, you know. Â  If you want to support The Guamaso and want to pick up some keychains follow this <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to my Amazon Store</a>.</p>

        <p>As the resident stay at home parent, I am now in charge of many house duties. Â  Fixing the bed? Â  Me. Â  Cleaning? Always has been me. Â  Animal caretaker? Â  Me. Â  Cooking? Â  Me. Â  (I'm so gonna get hell for that second one.) Â  I don't mind these responsibilities, as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of them. Â  Especially cooking. Â  I'm not sure what it is, probably something to do with my geekyness, but I have so much fun creating meals from ingredients.</p>
<figure style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img title="Rocky Road Cookie" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3182/2979623973_35c97060cf_m.jpg?resize=240%2C180" alt="" width="240" height="180" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rocky Road Cookie</figcaption></figure>
<p>I do have to admit that cooking over a stove is an animal, but baking is a true beast! Â  Some would say the stove is a bit more difficult, but I say the oven is unforgiving.</p>
<p>I am starting with easy recipes. Â  A couple of weeks ago I tried some cookies by using a cake mix. Â  The recipe was on the box and I kick myself for not copying it down. Â  The cookies turned out great, a little overcooked - which is why I said &quot;unforgiving&quot; - but still yummy. Â  I could have used the recipe today, but since I didn't keep it, I had to result to the internet.</p>
<p>I found a recipe that sounded about right and went to work. Â  First I made a batch without <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">mushrooms</span> marshmallows since Ciri doesn't care for them. Side note: I must have some sort of dyslexia because everytime I want to say marshmallows, I say mushrooms instead. Â  It also seems to extend into my typing. Â  Not good.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the first batch came out a bit cakey; very soft. Â  I followed the recipe, but for some reason the cookies came out like cookie-shaped cake. Â  Although, after they had time to cool down, they did harden a bit.</p>
<p>My second batch included the marshmallows. Â  This is where I say the oven is unforgiving. Â  The mallows overcooked, lost too much moisture and became rock hard. Â  I tried to cook them longer so that they would come out like cookies and not cake.</p>
<p>Afterward, I met with my personal chef trainer - the wife. Â  She advised me that I should try heavy cream instead of milk and maybe use two eggs instead of one. Â  I made them for her so we could have a <a href="http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/desserts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizookie</a> for desert tonight and I am just glad they were edible.</p>
<p>My next baking attempt will be homemade granola. Â  Stay tuned for that disaster. Â  *snicker* Â  I need to give myself more credit. Â  Oy.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe, be warned: they may come out like cake-ookies. Â  I got it from Cooks dot com.</p>
<p>1 pkg. semi-sweet chocolate chips</p>
<p>1 stick butter, softened</p>
<p>1/2 c. walnuts or pecans</p>
<p>1/2 c. oatmeal</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>1/3 c. milk</p>
<p>1 (2 layer size) cake mix, white for reg. cookies or chocolate for chocolate chocolate chip.</p>
<p>Get the <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,186,159189-234199,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rest of it at cooks dot com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I had some cookies yesterday from this batch and they were exceptional. Â  I take everything bad back about this recipe- it doesn't need to be changed. Â  I do remember having to cook them a little longer though. Â  Marshmallows are still a No-go.</p>
