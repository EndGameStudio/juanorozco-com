<p>We just watched The Dark Knight Sunday night after an afternoon of tamale making and gorging.   We had Ciri's dad, step-mom, and step-grandma over, so we had a nice assembly line going.   After they left, we sat on the couch and popped in The Dark Knight.</p>
<p>I wanted to watch this movie way before Heath Ledger died, and it sucks that some people have hyped it up based on it being Ledger's last performance.   I wanted to watch it because the first one was great and because Heath Ledger was, at the very least, an interesting choice for The Joker.</p>
<p>I grew up with Jack Nicholson's Joker; people before me grew up with Cesar Romero and his mustache.   Right away, people started comparing the three actors' interpretations of the Joker.   This is a natural reaction, albeit a flawed reaction.   I am partial to Jack Nicholson's rendition, but I don't think that it is fair to compare the three since they all took place during different periods of American culture.   Apples and oranges.</p>
<p>I wanted to believe the hype, but people these days are so eager to jump on some bandwagon or another.   I resisted believing everybody's opinion until I saw the movie for myself.</p>
<p>So Ciri and I finally got a chance to sit down and watch the movie after we put Izzy down for bed.   I don't want to review the movie, except I do want to say that without Heath Ledger, the movie would have been crap.   Period.</p>
<p>In the scene where he is robbing the bank we get our first meeting with the Joker.   This single, short scene gave me chills.   I could not believe what I was seeing.   He did meet the hype - in Ciri's unbiased opinion, he actually exceeded it.   He was really a bad ass Joker.</p>
<p>This brought up so many questions, though.   Is his Joker the best live action Joker?   Is his performance really worth a nomination or even an award?   For the former, you can't say his is the best.   You just can't.   Go back to the 80's and relive the hype of Jack's Joker and tell me they can be compared.   No way.</p>
<p>As for the nomination.   He was good.   Damn good.   He brought something to the Joker that none of his predecessors could, and he did it right.   Not just &quot;good&quot;, but &quot;right.&quot;   Ciri and I went back and analyzed many other villains from comic book movies.   William Dafoe bombed in Spiderman, I think.   Kevin Spacey was pretty good, but it wasn't anything amazing.   There's more, but you get the point.</p>
<p>I was hesitant to say he deserves an award at first because I thought it would be marred with the extra hype his performance received after his death.   If he hadn't died, would people still think he deserved an award?   Maybe not as many people would think so, but overall, I'm convinced he earned an award.</p>
<p>We decided that Heath Ledger's Joker, was by far the best performance of all the other superhero flicks.   And not only was he the best, but he also set a very, very high bar for any actor that wants to play a villain after this.</p>

        <p>I have a ton of posts that I work on a little at a time.   Some of my posts I do in one sitting if I am motivated enough.   This week has been very busy and I feel a little burned out.   Two things usually cheer me up when I feel burned out.   Video games and comics.</p>
<p>I've been earning stars on all the cups in Mario Kart recently, but I don't feel like playing that right now.   I might log in to WoW, but then I realized I haven't read my webcomics today!   I figured I should write a post on my favorite webcomics.   It's filler material, but oh well, everyone should read webcomics!</p>
<p>I've mentioned some of these in the past a few times.   Here's a list of my must reads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://penny-arcade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penny Arcade</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reallifecomics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Life</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sheldoncomics.com">Sheldon Comics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://silentkimbly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Kimbly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://boasas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boy and a Stick and Slither</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kukuburi.com">Kukuburi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vgcats.com/super" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supereffective</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vgcats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG Cats</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wetherobots.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We the Robots</a></li>
</ul>
<p>VG cats was one of the first comics I started reading and I think I have a connection to it because the artist uses cats as his main characters.   <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/02/22/im-a-cat-person-dammit">I like cats</a>.   He also does Super-effective which is based on the original Pokemon game and is freaking hilarious, but definitely not for kids!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://reallifecomics.com/archive/080515.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first strip I read of Real Life</a> reminded me of Ciri and me.   It was so funny, I had to go back and read the archives.   I've been reading it ever since.</p>
<p>The rest of the comics are just as funny and artistic, I even have some strips as my desktop because they are very meaningful or just outright hilarious.</p>
<p>I used to read a lot more, but they either lost their appeal to me or just weren't interesting in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, now that I'm done with this, I am off to finish some chores around here.</p>

<p>Here I am, sitting at my computer again, virtual-window shopping.   I'm staring at the <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion for World of Warcraft</a> like some little kid hoping that an onlooker will feel bad for me and buy it for me.   Damn online shopping...</p>
<p>Seriously, I would like to get my hands on a copy, but I am in no hurry.   I play the game for the story and the adventure - which is a nice way of saying I am not level 70 yet.   I started playing around April of last year and my main character, <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Sisters+of+Elune&n=Odiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odium, is currently at level 47</a>.   I have two or three characters in the mid thirties as well, but none of them are as fun, to me, as my Rogue (hence, RogueDad.   Sneaky sneaky).   I would be level 70 by now, but I have other commitments in life, that and I am slow...</p>
<p>So because I am such a low level, I can't take part in much of the new content.   Although, the recent patch introduced enough content and features to keep me happy.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, though, I logged in last night to see how the world was doing and I was really hoping to catch my first glimpse at the new class, the Death Knights.   I got on the zeppelin to Kalimdor and there's a crazy lookin' blood elf on her mount standing at the front, all dressed in black.   &quot;Gasp&quot; and &quot;Rawr!&quot;   Death Knights are <em>awe-some</em> (especially female blood elves)!</p>
<p>The new patch and expansion introduced some new elements to the storyline as well as tons of other cool stuff, so I am really excited to see how this whole &quot;war against the Burning Legion&quot; turns out.   Until I reach level 70 and our finances pick up again, Wrath of the Lich King will have to wait.   That is, unless, someone would like to <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000VJTJNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsor me... 😉<br /> </a></p>
