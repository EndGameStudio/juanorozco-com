        <p>I've started up my personal journal again.  (Yes, I am writing a diary...)  Only this time, I thought I'd try a virtual journal in the hopes that I would continue writing in it longer than a few months.  I enjoy writing and chronicling my thoughts, but writing in a book never worked out for me.  I would jot down my thoughts and ideas more often if I could write from anywhere and anytime.  What better way to write on the go than with my iPhone?</p>
<p>The first thought I had was to search for some sort of iPhone app that was password protected.  I found a few, some free and some at a small premium.  Writing from the iPhone is convenient when there isn't a full size keyboard around, but I would rather use a computer when it is available.  So if I was going to buy an app, it would need to sync with some online service or at least sync with my PC.  I couldn't find any apps that had this functionality so I thought of just using a webapp instead.</p>
<p>Immediately, I found this cool service called <a href="http://penzu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penzu</a>.  It's a very well thought out service and really simple to use.  It's completely private and, unlike a public blog, the individual entries don't have a URL for robots to scan.  Let's say someone figured out your password, each entrycan be individually locked and would therefore require a second password to view.</p>
<p>It's also well designed.  When you visit the site you can start writing right away by clicking on the <a href="http://penzu.com/pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;try it out&quot;</a> link. After you're done writing, just log in and it will save the entry automatically.  As you're writing, the text appears on what looks like a sheet of lined paper.  Like I said, really cool site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, writing on it in Safari on the iPhone is really cumbersome.  I was typing pretty fast and after a while, I had to stop so it would catch up with me.  The site is really good, and adding an iPhone app would make it the best private journaling application I could find.  I ended up not using it because of how the iPhone interacted with it.</p>
<p>This search turned out to be a little more drawn out then I thought it would be.  I thought of  using <a href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> or the Notes app, but I thought I would look at Blogger and WordPress first to see if there was a &quot;private&quot; setting.  I created a blog at WordPress.com first and set it to private.  Using the WordPress iPhone app, I was able to log-in to the blog and start writing.  I checked to make sure I couldn't access the site if I wasn't logged in and that the RSS feed was not displaying either.  So far, this seems like a pretty good solution.</p>
<p>Evernote could work as well since I have the desktop application and the iPhone application.  It wouldn't be as  efficient since it's designed for quick note taking, plus I'm a huge WordPress fan so using the WordPress.com blogs is ideal for me.  <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogger </a>allows for private settings too, but I couldn't find an iPhone app for it.</p>
<p>I honestly hope that Penzu releases an iPhone app to go with their web application - I'll switch over if they do. Penzu is designed to be private unlike WordPress which is designed to be public.  Either way, WordPress is a good solution for now and hopefully I'll keep up with this journal-keeping quest for once.</p>

        <p>This shortened URL business really has gotten out of hand.  <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morning Toast</a> <a href="http://www.morningtoast.com/2009/05/why-tiny-urls-change-how-we-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote a rant</a> about it a few days ago and it got me thinking about their usefulness.  He also twittered about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrideas/discuss/72157616526758077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr's own URL shortener</a> as well.  Although Flickr uses a different domain name for these shortened URLs, the link is still obvious about it's context; it is a Flickr image.</p>
<p>I found out about this idea of using &quot;<a href="http://revcanonical.appspot.com/">rev=canonical</a>&quot; within a link.  I'm still trying to understand the whole concept: essentially if a link is created, a shortener service checks if the link owner has already shortened it.  If the owner has indeed shortened it, the shortener service will provide the owner's short URL to the request-or.  That's way to complicated for me, but it would be nice have my own shortened links when I post them to a service like Twitter.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<p>I remembered that when you first install WordPress, &quot;pretty&quot; permalinks are deactivated.  Running in this default mode, a post link looks like this: <a href="http://guamaso.com/?p=293">http://guamaso.com/?p=293</a>.  It still doesn't have the context of the post itself, but at least now you know that it is related to The Guamaso.  It may not be shorter than <a href="http://bit.ly/1m4Qp">http://bit.ly/1m4Qp</a>, but the added context is worth it to me.</p>
<p>So how do I implement this &quot;built-in shortener?&quot;  I use Twitter Tools to automatically send a blog post to Twitter.  Why not use Twitter Tools to send the short URL instead of the pretty URL!  I changed a few things on line 466:</p>
<p>**$shorturl = get_bloginfo('url');</p>
<p>$shorturl .= &quot;/?p=&quot;;</p>
<p>$shorturl .= $post_id;**</p>
<p>LINE 466: $url = apply_filters('tweet_blog_post_url', <strong>$shorturl</strong>);</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: The items in bold are what I changed / added.</strong></p>
<p>I sent a a test &quot;twit&quot; to Twitter earlier and it worked (actually, I initially forgot to add the &quot;p&quot; but it's in there now.).  So instead of passing the full permalink that will get shortened by Twitter anyway, it now sends the shorter WordPress URL that starts with my domain name.  Boom.</p>
<p>I don't think a reader can find the post's ID without direct access to the Admin area, so providing this short link for the reader to use is the <em>key</em> to making this method successful.  I'd also like to see more plugins that use these shorter links when posting to Twitter.  It makes way more sense then letting Twitter make the decision.  On the other hand, blogs that post 10+ entries a day may out grow it in a few years... but hey, maybe by then we'll jump to the next social trend anyway.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2: Scratch everything I just said!  Don't edit Twitter Tools, instead download the <a title="Twitter Friendly Links Plug In" href="http://kovshenin.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-friendly-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Friendly Links plug-in</a>.  It works with rev=canonical, Twitter Tools, and it will also add the short link on your posts for your readers.  The best part is it will make the link shorter than with the hack I explained above.  Instead of <a href="../?p=293">http://guamaso.com/?p=293</a> it will be [][2]<a href="/293">http://guamaso.com/293</a>. Good plugin, give it a try!</strong></p>

        <p>Dramatic title, right? Well, it's just my opinion, but from the confirmed specs listed on <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/press/2009/0526-zunehd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft's release</a> about the new Zune HD, I believe it is doomed to reside in the shadow of Apple's iPod alongside the rest of it's brethren. If things change between today and it's release then maybe the Zune HD has a chance. The people are eager to have choices in a Portable Media Player and therefore eager for the Zune brand to succeed. I know I am.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1747" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1747" title="zunehd" src="https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/zunehd-300x232.jpg?resize=300%2C232" alt="Zune HD" width="300" height="232" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1747" class="wp-caption-text">Zune HD</figcaption></figure>
<p>At first blush, the Zune HD is beautiful, inside and out. OLED multi-touch screen, HD Radio, HD Video playback, Wi-Fi, and web browsing all in a nicely designed package. Then, a closer look reveals that the unit is missing some important information. Is there going to be an &quot;app store?&quot; Did they increase the DPI on the screen? (The iPod Touch DPI is 163ppi.) Internet Explorer based browsing? Really? Cost? Hard drive size? (If you want HD video, it'd better be larger than 32GB.)</p>
<p>The biggest issue here is some sort of third party application delivery. Without the app store, the Ipod Touch would just be a fancy media player. The applications bring it to a whole new level. Not really a PDA but not only a media player. In order for people to switch over to the Zune HD, they have to know that they'll receive the same experience, i.e. downloadable applications of all types and purposes. So far, a few games aren't going to persuade users. I want to download my email, send a &quot;twit&quot; on Twitter, I want to be able to post on WordPress from it! <strong>That</strong> is the strength of the iPod touch. If the Zune HD really is meant to go &quot;head to head&quot; than that app store needs to open <em>soon</em>.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm all for Microsoft succeeding and providing us with more choices for out entertainment delivery. The Zune HD does some things right. HD Radio is the future (distant, but certain) and I am glad that it is included. Although I wonder about the reception, our car's HD radio reception isn't all that great. OLED screens will save on battery power and, unlike LCD technology, OLED can display true blacks.</p>
<p>If the Zune wanted to pull ahead of Apple, they would add a microphone and a video capable camera to the unit along with their own app store. That's the winning combination right there.</p>
<p>Like I said, I hope that the Zune HD becomes a viable option in the PMP market, but I really doubt it will. That seems to be the Zune legacy.</p>
