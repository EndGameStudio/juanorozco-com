        <p>Last week Ciriana told me that her Sergeant was going to give Ciriana a &quot;good-bye&quot; luncheon. Â  Although Ciri's official last day isn't until May, her last day in the clinic is nigh. Â  Her Sergeant asked me to send her pictures of Ciriana in a bite suit from a re-enlistment ceremony in Germany. Â  The photo was mounted onto a plaque that Ciriana received during the luncheon - it is pretty awesome looking.</p>
<p>When her Sergeant told me what she was going to do with the pictures, I didn't think about getting Ciriana anything just from me, except maybe some flowers. Â  That is, Â  until Sunday afternoon. Â  Remember that episode of Scrubs with the &quot;epiphany toilet?&quot; Â  Well, I get epiphany's in the bathroom too, only mine are in the shower. Â  So, there I am lathering, rinsing, and repeating, when it hits me. Â  Ciriana wanted a coin display for her challenge coins. Â  All of the ones I've seen are either ugly or just blah. Â  So... &quot;Why not design and make one myself,&quot; I thought as I scrubbed my nether regions.</p>
<p>My creativity is weird. Â  It comes in waves... BIG spread out waves. Â  Once I get an idea, my creativity goes into overdrive. Â  I could do it this way, or I could do it that way... oh! It would be so cool... etc. etc. Â  It wasn't until Monday that I finally had a pretty good sketch of what I was going to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Final Display" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3350680194_10b3da055e.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Everything about the display means something. Â  Ciriana and I have an equal amount of good and bad experiences with the Army, which is why I decided to make it two different colors. Â  Like all things in life, you have to take in the good along with the bad - that's just life, right? Â  The coins placed over these two colors are part of the &quot;military life&quot; and bring the two colors together as a whole. Â  I don't think the cat and the dog need explaining. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The whole process took about three days - with work being done during nap time and a little after dark as well. Â  The fun thing about this project was learning how to work with wood. Â  I started watching wood working podcasts with the hope that I would take up woodworking as a hobby. Â  Without some of the podcasts and blogs, like <a href="http://thewoodwhisperer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wood Whisperer</a>, I would not have even known where to start. Â  I was able to walk into the garage and things just started coming together. Â  I figured out how to use the tools like the chisels, the Dremel, and more.</p>
<p>While I was getting Izzy ready, I looked at the display sitting on the counter and thought, &quot;Holy crap. Â  <em>I made that!</em>&quot; Â  It is a wonderful feeling to create something all on your own, especially for a notorious computer nerd like myself.</p>
<p>I'm inspired to work more with wood and create more crazy stuff. Â  For now, this wave of inspiration and creativity has passed, and I did say these waves are far apart, so who knows when my next project will be. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr set</a> for the entire collection of photos I took while making the display.</p>

        <p>Just a quick post to explain the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest Flickr images</a>. Â  The top secret gift for Ciri's party tomorrow is a Challenge Coin Display. Â  A custom display, that is. Â  Made by me. Â  That actually doesn't mean anything because without a keyboard and a mouse, my hands are worthless.</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img title="Challenge Coin Display" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3348621042_10dbd5a2d1.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Challenge Coin Display" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Challenge Coin Display</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ciriana has wanted a display for her coins for a long time, but they can get kind of expensive. Â  It only hit me this past weekend that it would be a great to create one for her.</p>
<p>I only found out about her party last week, so I ran out of time and what you see above is pretty much where I am at as of Wednesday night. Â  Both pieces have one coat of poly, and only two of the three shelves are ready to go. Â  Tomorrow morning I'll put the entire thing together except for the third shelf.</p>
<p>If you look at the flickr set, the template I printed out has Ciri's name and the Specialist logo on it. Â  I thought I would be able to take care of that tomorrow morning, but it doesn't sound like I'm going to have time to locate a Specialist patch and get the engraving done before the party.</p>
<p>I did get pretty far with the limited time I had and with the limited skills I possess. Â  At least Ciri will get to see it for the first time tomorrow morning, even though it is incomplete. Â  Either way, I can't wait to see her face!</p>
<p>I'll have a full write up on this tomorrow night. Â  Hopefully I'll finish up the last shelf and give it one more coat of poly over the weekend.</p>

        <p>It's a been a while since I last wrote an entry, a little longer than I would like. Â  I have a few posts waiting to get edited, but I've been so busy with the kid, the house, and projects that as soon as I sit down to edit my stuff, I start falling asleep. Â  ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>For now, I just wanted to pop in and spill some details on <a href="http://guamaso.com/2009/02/16/challenge-coin-design-contest">the coin design</a>. Â  The dog bone shape design was picked as the winning design. Yay! Â  I got an email from the commander expressing his thanks and admiration for the designs. Â  He liked the coin a lot, but he had some changes he wanted done to certain parts of the design.</p>
<p>I've made the revisions and I believe that the final design is, well, finalized. Â  I'm not sure how long it takes to mint these things, but I wanted to wait on showing the final design until I had one in my grubby little fingers. Â  I'm curious how big and how thick they will be. Â  Some coins leave the metal exposed while others have a clear coating over the entire face - I wonder which they will choose.</p>
<p>Anyway, seeing the final design alongside the actual coin would be a ideal. Â  We'll see what goes down.</p>
<p>A quick note, I made a light box using <a href="http://www.thedomesticscientist.com/2008/07/15/quick-and-dirty-lightbox-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domestic Scientist's instructions</a> and have gone picture crazy. Â  I posted the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best ones on Flickr</a>. Â  Take a look and tell me what you think. Â  I also took this opportunity to take the photos in RAW. Â  More on that later, though. Â  See ya.</p>
