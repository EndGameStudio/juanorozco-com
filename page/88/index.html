        <p>I made lasagna for dinner today, turkey and cheese, mm-mmm.  I used a recipe off of the <a href="http://allrecipes.com/features/more/iphone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AllRecipe.com app for iPhone</a>.  It turned out to be the best meat lasagna I've ever eaten.</p>
<figure style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright">[<img title="Flickr Onion" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2990656711_a7a3860b5b_m.jpg?resize=160%2C240" alt="Flickr User: adulau" width="160" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Flickr User: adulau</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I was chopping some onions, I came to the realization that I actually enjoy chopping onions. It's like one of those tasks that are so arduous and annoying, but in the end, very satisfying. It's like an affirmation of our superiority on this planet.  Or, think of it as a battle, a battle with bayonets, chemical warfare, death, and the devouring of your enemies. (Ok, just follow me with this.  I have a point. Promise.)</p>
<p>See, onions didn't always emit noxious fumes that, when collected in your eyes, incapacitate you.  I'm sure at one point onions were docile little root-balls, tasty, but docile.  (I have no real evidence of this, I'm just sayin'.)  Then through generations of evolution, they developed a very effective defense system that is present in today's onion.  Humans have yet to develop an immunity to this defensive tactic.  But we do have one thing the onion doesn't: resolve.</p>
<p>So there I am, chopping the seemingly defenseless onion to bits.  It's ultimate fate?  Sauteed with a pound of ground turkey. It is knife versus wussy onion skin.  Then my eyes begin to water - the fight has gone from hand-to-hand combat to chemical warfare.  If I wipe the tears, the chemical just waits for more tears and continues its attack. The easiest counter to the onions defenses is to wear those awesome <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/guamaso-20/detail/B000H43IVC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">onion goggles</a> - but c'mon where is the victory in that?  Personally, I chose to just stick it out.  Cut a few times, then dab the tears with my sleeve.  Repeat until completely chopped.</p>
<p>There's something to be said about people that don't take short cuts, that just &quot;suck it up&quot; and continue forward.  I'm not saying people that use the onion goggles are lesser humans, but the victory is sweeter without them.  In short, chopping onions is proof of, not only our superiority, but our unlimited strength and ingenuity.</p>
<p>I now realize that I need to have some background noise going on while I cook.  Nevertheless, my point has been made and I still feel it is valid.  Now, go fight the onion horde, comrade, and hold your head high.</p>

        <p>Last week Ciriana told me that her Sergeant was going to give Ciriana a &quot;good-bye&quot; luncheon.   Although Ciri's official last day isn't until May, her last day in the clinic is nigh.   Her Sergeant asked me to send her pictures of Ciriana in a bite suit from a re-enlistment ceremony in Germany.   The photo was mounted onto a plaque that Ciriana received during the luncheon - it is pretty awesome looking.</p>
<p>When her Sergeant told me what she was going to do with the pictures, I didn't think about getting Ciriana anything just from me, except maybe some flowers.   That is,   until Sunday afternoon.   Remember that episode of Scrubs with the &quot;epiphany toilet?&quot;   Well, I get epiphany's in the bathroom too, only mine are in the shower.   So, there I am lathering, rinsing, and repeating, when it hits me.   Ciriana wanted a coin display for her challenge coins.   All of the ones I've seen are either ugly or just blah.   So... &quot;Why not design and make one myself,&quot; I thought as I scrubbed my nether regions.</p>
<p>My creativity is weird.   It comes in waves... BIG spread out waves.   Once I get an idea, my creativity goes into overdrive.   I could do it this way, or I could do it that way... oh! It would be so cool... etc. etc.   It wasn't until Monday that I finally had a pretty good sketch of what I was going to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Final Display" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3350680194_10b3da055e.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Everything about the display means something.   Ciriana and I have an equal amount of good and bad experiences with the Army, which is why I decided to make it two different colors.   Like all things in life, you have to take in the good along with the bad - that's just life, right?   The coins placed over these two colors are part of the &quot;military life&quot; and bring the two colors together as a whole.   I don't think the cat and the dog need explaining. 🙂</p>
<p>The whole process took about three days - with work being done during nap time and a little after dark as well.   The fun thing about this project was learning how to work with wood.   I started watching wood working podcasts with the hope that I would take up woodworking as a hobby.   Without some of the podcasts and blogs, like <a href="http://thewoodwhisperer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wood Whisperer</a>, I would not have even known where to start.   I was able to walk into the garage and things just started coming together.   I figured out how to use the tools like the chisels, the Dremel, and more.</p>
<p>While I was getting Izzy ready, I looked at the display sitting on the counter and thought, &quot;Holy crap.   <em>I made that!</em>&quot;   It is a wonderful feeling to create something all on your own, especially for a notorious computer nerd like myself.</p>
<p>I'm inspired to work more with wood and create more crazy stuff.   For now, this wave of inspiration and creativity has passed, and I did say these waves are far apart, so who knows when my next project will be. 😉</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr set</a> for the entire collection of photos I took while making the display.</p>

        <p>Just a quick post to explain the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theguamaso/sets/72157615128976122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest Flickr images</a>.   The top secret gift for Ciri's party tomorrow is a Challenge Coin Display.   A custom display, that is.   Made by me.   That actually doesn't mean anything because without a keyboard and a mouse, my hands are worthless.</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img title="Challenge Coin Display" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3348621042_10dbd5a2d1.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Challenge Coin Display" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Challenge Coin Display</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ciriana has wanted a display for her coins for a long time, but they can get kind of expensive.   It only hit me this past weekend that it would be a great to create one for her.</p>
<p>I only found out about her party last week, so I ran out of time and what you see above is pretty much where I am at as of Wednesday night.   Both pieces have one coat of poly, and only two of the three shelves are ready to go.   Tomorrow morning I'll put the entire thing together except for the third shelf.</p>
<p>If you look at the flickr set, the template I printed out has Ciri's name and the Specialist logo on it.   I thought I would be able to take care of that tomorrow morning, but it doesn't sound like I'm going to have time to locate a Specialist patch and get the engraving done before the party.</p>
<p>I did get pretty far with the limited time I had and with the limited skills I possess.   At least Ciri will get to see it for the first time tomorrow morning, even though it is incomplete.   Either way, I can't wait to see her face!</p>
<p>I'll have a full write up on this tomorrow night.   Hopefully I'll finish up the last shelf and give it one more coat of poly over the weekend.</p>
