        <p>I started a new character a while back, a hunter this time.   I avoided the hunter class because a good portion of players chose it over any other class.   I can understand why, it's a simple class for beginners but also complex enough for experts.   I don't like doing what everybody else is doing, so I chose a Rogue instead.</p>
<p><span>Well, I finally gave in a few months ago.   I made a troll hunter and named him Asbestos.   My server went up for a free transfer and I chose to transfer all my characters to a different server, when I did, I had to change his name to <span>Cavemon</span> since Asbestos was already taken on the new server.<br /> </span></p>
<p><span>I really want to create a complete back story for all my <span>toons</span>, but for now I just want to show off my little cat collection and give a small role-playing background too.</span></p>
<h3><span><span></p></h3>
<p>
  <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Cavemon and Pringles" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3131950315_b669faf774_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Pringles" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Pringles</figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>
  Pringles the Ghost Saber
</p>
<p>
  </span></span></h3> 
  <p>
    <span><span>Pringles</span> was really the reason why I wanted a hunter.   He is a ghost saber, which is why he is somewhat transparent.   No other cat in the game uses this texture - when not in stealth.   That's why I wanted him, because of his unique coloring and transparency.   He's a cool cat, too, listens pretty good.   Loves his stomach being rubbed, which is weird because he is a ghost cat...</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciriana</span> was surprised that I didn't name <span>Pringles</span> after my real-life cat: <span>Jefe</span>.   I didn't think <span>Pringles</span> looked like <span>Jefe</span> at all, so I decided he needed a random name.   There was a tube of <span>pringles</span> on my desk and I thought it would make a neat name for a cat.   He is my favorite pet, but I am trying to focus on my tanking pet while I am questing on my own.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Jefe the Night Saber<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>So after <span>Ciriana</span> made me feel bad for not having a cat like my <span>Jefe</span>, I went out and found a striped cat.   For those that don't know, <span>Jefe</span> - or <span>Jefe'n</span> as we now call him thanks to <span>Ciri's</span> four year old brother- is a trouble maker.   I think he is half <span>savannah</span> because his stomach has spots and his fur is very soft, otherwise he is all tabby.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <figure style="width: 192px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Cavemon and Jefe" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3131950169_14e48c850e_m.jpg?resize=192%2C240" alt="Cavemon and Jefe" width="192" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cavemon and Jefe</figcaption></figure>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>So the virtual <span>Jefe</span> is a young cat with ADD and an affinity for causing trouble.   He loves taunting and annoying <span>Pringles</span> by running through him.   He also likes carrying <span>Ciri</span>, my pet crab, around pretending he is going to eat him.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    He is quite the handful.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span><span>Ciri the Crab<br /> </span></span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span>Can you guess why I named my newest tanking pet <span>Ciri</span>?   As I mentioned above, <span>Ciri</span> is a crab, both in-game and in real life.   😉   I thought it was a perfect name for my new crab and <span>Ciriana</span> does a great impression of a crab.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span><span>Ciri</span> the crab hates cats.   I found her on a fishing trip in <span>Duratar</span> after she gave <span>Jefe</span> the one finger salute.   Don't ask me how a crab is able to flip someone off, she just did.   After I tried throwing her back in the ocean, she jumped back out and followed me back to the city.   She is not my pet, she is just hanging around so she can kill <span>Jefe</span>.   Something about Jefe eating her family.</span>
  </p>

    </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  Izzy the Gorilla&lt;/h3&gt; 
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;, so I don't really have a pet named Izzy just yet, but I will!   I'm going to get a gorilla as soon as I am leveled enough.   We call Izzy a little monkey and I thought it would be fun to have a gorilla named after Izzy in the game.   I know that gorillas aren't monkeys, but it's still funny.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;The gorilla I want is a baby gorilla, but from what I am reading it is untamable.   Which really sucks - it would be perfect since I am naming it after a baby.   I'll just have to find another gorilla that is somewhat cute.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Most likely I will have to get rid of my crab once I do get a gorilla since I don't have enough gold to keep so many pets in the stables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h3&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_1286&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/families/family_spiritbeast.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-1286&quot; title=&quot;harkoa&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/guamaso.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/harkoa-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;Jefe Rebooted&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-1286&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Jefe Rebooted&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Jefe: Rebooted
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Petopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great reference for Hunters that need detailed info on the different pets in World of &lt;span&gt;Warcraft&lt;/span&gt;.   Since I don't have the newest patch- Wrath of the &lt;span&gt;Lich&lt;/span&gt; King - I didn't know they introduced new pets like rhinos and spirit beasts.     After reading through Petopia I found out that the only spirit beast currently &lt;span&gt;tamable&lt;/span&gt; by Hunters is &quot;&lt;span&gt;Loque'naha&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;   He's basically a cat, but with some different moves and an awesome coloring scheme!&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;I will role play this by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; either&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; just adding him to my troupe, or by making &lt;span&gt;Jefe&lt;/span&gt; into this cat.   I will release the cat I have now and rename this new one.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The story will be something like &lt;span&gt;Jefe was&lt;/span&gt; hit by a car and the only doctor opened at the time was some crazy undead dude that turned him into a glowing bad-ass super cat.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;This is a long ways away, since the beast is a level 76 elite and Cavemon   just barely leveled to 25.   I probably won't be able to tame this pet until at least level 75 and only with the help of others.   Plus he is a rare pet that only shows up every now and then.&lt;/span&gt;

<p>We just watched The Dark Knight Sunday night after an afternoon of tamale making and gorging.   We had Ciri's dad, step-mom, and step-grandma over, so we had a nice assembly line going.   After they left, we sat on the couch and popped in The Dark Knight.</p>
<p>I wanted to watch this movie way before Heath Ledger died, and it sucks that some people have hyped it up based on it being Ledger's last performance.   I wanted to watch it because the first one was great and because Heath Ledger was, at the very least, an interesting choice for The Joker.</p>
<p>I grew up with Jack Nicholson's Joker; people before me grew up with Cesar Romero and his mustache.   Right away, people started comparing the three actors' interpretations of the Joker.   This is a natural reaction, albeit a flawed reaction.   I am partial to Jack Nicholson's rendition, but I don't think that it is fair to compare the three since they all took place during different periods of American culture.   Apples and oranges.</p>
<p>I wanted to believe the hype, but people these days are so eager to jump on some bandwagon or another.   I resisted believing everybody's opinion until I saw the movie for myself.</p>
<p>So Ciri and I finally got a chance to sit down and watch the movie after we put Izzy down for bed.   I don't want to review the movie, except I do want to say that without Heath Ledger, the movie would have been crap.   Period.</p>
<p>In the scene where he is robbing the bank we get our first meeting with the Joker.   This single, short scene gave me chills.   I could not believe what I was seeing.   He did meet the hype - in Ciri's unbiased opinion, he actually exceeded it.   He was really a bad ass Joker.</p>
<p>This brought up so many questions, though.   Is his Joker the best live action Joker?   Is his performance really worth a nomination or even an award?   For the former, you can't say his is the best.   You just can't.   Go back to the 80's and relive the hype of Jack's Joker and tell me they can be compared.   No way.</p>
<p>As for the nomination.   He was good.   Damn good.   He brought something to the Joker that none of his predecessors could, and he did it right.   Not just &quot;good&quot;, but &quot;right.&quot;   Ciri and I went back and analyzed many other villains from comic book movies.   William Dafoe bombed in Spiderman, I think.   Kevin Spacey was pretty good, but it wasn't anything amazing.   There's more, but you get the point.</p>
<p>I was hesitant to say he deserves an award at first because I thought it would be marred with the extra hype his performance received after his death.   If he hadn't died, would people still think he deserved an award?   Maybe not as many people would think so, but overall, I'm convinced he earned an award.</p>
<p>We decided that Heath Ledger's Joker, was by far the best performance of all the other superhero flicks.   And not only was he the best, but he also set a very, very high bar for any actor that wants to play a villain after this.</p>

        <p>I have a ton of posts that I work on a little at a time.   Some of my posts I do in one sitting if I am motivated enough.   This week has been very busy and I feel a little burned out.   Two things usually cheer me up when I feel burned out.   Video games and comics.</p>
<p>I've been earning stars on all the cups in Mario Kart recently, but I don't feel like playing that right now.   I might log in to WoW, but then I realized I haven't read my webcomics today!   I figured I should write a post on my favorite webcomics.   It's filler material, but oh well, everyone should read webcomics!</p>
<p>I've mentioned some of these in the past a few times.   Here's a list of my must reads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://penny-arcade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penny Arcade</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reallifecomics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Life</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sheldoncomics.com">Sheldon Comics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://silentkimbly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Kimbly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://boasas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boy and a Stick and Slither</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kukuburi.com">Kukuburi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vgcats.com/super" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supereffective</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vgcats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG Cats</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wetherobots.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We the Robots</a></li>
</ul>
<p>VG cats was one of the first comics I started reading and I think I have a connection to it because the artist uses cats as his main characters.   <a href="http://guamaso.com/2008/02/22/im-a-cat-person-dammit">I like cats</a>.   He also does Super-effective which is based on the original Pokemon game and is freaking hilarious, but definitely not for kids!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://reallifecomics.com/archive/080515.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first strip I read of Real Life</a> reminded me of Ciri and me.   It was so funny, I had to go back and read the archives.   I've been reading it ever since.</p>
<p>The rest of the comics are just as funny and artistic, I even have some strips as my desktop because they are very meaningful or just outright hilarious.</p>
<p>I used to read a lot more, but they either lost their appeal to me or just weren't interesting in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, now that I'm done with this, I am off to finish some chores around here.</p>
