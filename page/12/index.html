<p>There's publishings out there saying we live in a throw-away-I-want-it-now culture. <strong>They're probably right.</strong></p>
<p>I fall into that pit from time to time. I've been known to go to the store for something I need simply because I'd rather not wait the week for free shipping to delivery my item.</p>
<p>But, the majority of the time, I love the idea of fixing, rebuilding, and manufacturing my own things. I've rebuilt car engines, replaced a scratched camera lens on my old iPhone, built my own computers, and, mostly because of my job, coded my own web things.</p>
<h2>Building is power {#buildingispower}</h2>
<p>Building your own thing is empowering, fun, and challenging. It's the complete opposite of the instant gratification culture, but the payback is ten times better.</p>
<p>The engine I rebuilt is still running. It wasn't easy. Some days I was cursing the engineers who designed it. Other days were full of heavy work. But the day I inserted the key to start the engine... oh wow... it was amazing. I was scared as hell to turn the key but when I did and the engine came back to life... I never felt so powerful.</p>
<p>If I could rebuild an engine, a precision machine with high tolerances, I could do <strong>anything</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ANYTHING.</strong></p>
<h2>Build for building's sake {#buildforbuildingssake}</h2>
<p>I love photography, so I'm building <a href="https://www.juanorozco.com/tag/photoblog/">my own photo blogging page</a> (mainly because I prefer control over my photos but also for fun). I love audio so I've started to research how to build my own headphones. Will I finish these projects? Who knows. Finishing isn't always the point, though.</p>
<p>Build something just to build it. You might find you're not liking where your build is going. Or, maybe you need some resource you don't have access to. It is always ok to stop a project so long as you learned something new.</p>
<p><strong>So, get out there and build something, anything!</strong></p>

<p>I don’t like gyms, but I never knew why until today. Today was my first day doing CrossFit. Let me first get my thoughts out on CrossFit before I explain my discovery.</p>
<h2>CrossFit is bad ass {#crossfitisbadass}</h2>
<p>Specifically, the trainer we had. She was amazing. She was empathetic yet assertive; firm yet encouraging.</p>
<p>I assume that this level of personal trainer is on par with many types of gyms, not specific to CrossFit “boxes” (Ohhhh, look at me! Fancy jargon in effect!). Still, she was very helpful in pointing out problems with my form during the different styles of squats. My flat-ish feet are a big problem, for example, which cause me to not push my knees outward. This attention to form will help me better myself safely and efficiently and it’s an encouraging aspect of the environment.</p>
<p>The workout itself, though, doesn’t feel like it’s my thing. I was trying to explain this to Ciri and I think I have it right now:</p>
<p><strong>I need to solve problems.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why I love climbing so much. Or trail running. I haven’t done MoveNat or Parkour, but these styles are more my thing. I like the idea of navigating terrain, there is a certain strategy and mindset involved with getting from point A to point B efficiently and quickly.</p>
<p>Form is important in many, if not all workouts. Ciri believes that the act of keeping good form during extremely difficult workouts will help keep my mind engaged.</p>
<p><em>She’s probably right.</em></p>
<p>In case she isn’t, though, I like that CrossFit will help me improve my fitness to a level where I can venture out to other things like climbing and parkour. These are activities that I’ve wanted to do for so long but lacked the fitness to do so and enjoy them. Actually, I was climbing for a while until I switched to CrossFit with Ciri, but I sucked at climbing. My point is, I need to start somewhere. Might as well do it where community is an integral part of the workout.</p>

<p>We took this image at the <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a>. Jelly Fish are neat little creatures for many reasons. I really like watching them propel themselves through the water, almost effortlessly. Just how I would like to move.</p>

        <p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/m.creativeandflow.com/images/2015/02/wright.jpg"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/m.creativeandflow.com/images/2015/02/wright_sm.jpg?w=580" alt="Wright Memorial - Kitty Hawk, NC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I'm infatuated with the concept of iteration. As a creator of web things, I am no stranger to the concept. But as a member of society, father, husband, friend, and more; I've noticed more and more useful applications for iteration in all aspects of life outside of work.</p>
<p>As far as Creative and Flow goes, I've had goals and ideas and dreams for so long but with zero follow through. I wanted to make a web magazine on creativity in life but quickly realized how mentally taxing writing is. Coupled with trying to render this writing in a marketable way - it was too much. So I procrastinated and put off and, eventually, set it aside.</p>
<p>I would come back to Creative and Flow infrequently and post an article here or there. I would update the site to a different CMS. Sometimes I would even change the theme. Every time, hoping that the change itself was enough to spark some inspiration or jump start the drive to be consistent with the site.</p>
<p><strong>Nope.</strong></p>
<p>I fought with myself. On the one hand, I thought that I should just make it my &quot;personal blog&quot;. On the other hand I had my goals of making my own successful web magazine! Ugh. The internal war continued for a time.</p>
<p>I imagine this isn't uncommon. We hold off on doing something because we want it to happen a specific way, all the while, never actually doing the thing and losing out on both experiences all together.</p>
<p>When I realized I was doing this, I decided it was time to give up on the start-my-own-magazine dream. It sounds harsh but being dishonest about what you're capable of is harsher. Besides, I'm not giving up on writing a magazine at all; it's still on my bucket list.</p>
<p>I've learned over the past few years that creating small goals that build up to an over arching goal yields a higher success rate. Using this space for writing in order to build discipline as well as improving my writing are great first steps.</p>
<p>We're making big changes in our lifestyle over the next few years and I'd like to chronicle a lot of those changes. I run into problems at times and writing helps me figure out how I feel about the pending decision which is extremely helpful in making a better decision. Other times, something will tickle my fancy and I just have to share it. These ideas have all been skipped because of my apprehension over the use of this space.</p>
<p><strong>No more.</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to sharing my thoughts. I've got this.</p>

<h3>Cover image {#coverimage}</h3>
<p>We visisted the Wright memorial on October of 2014 and it was one of the more beautiful places I've been to. We stood on the ground where the first flights took place. We walked among the tools and elements the Wright brothers created because of their passion for flight.</p>
<p>I used this image because it reminded of how the brothers iterated their designs and their approaches to the problems they faced. Since the day the Wright flyer left the earth, humanity has never stopped iterating on the brothers' experiments.</p>
