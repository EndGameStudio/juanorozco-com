If I need to make an update, I copy the whole folder to an RC folder and work from there – this is how I branch or fork a version.  When I’m ready to commit that release, I give it a version based on the edits made and change the folder name to the new version number.

The folder would stay as RC but I keep the log going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the cycle continues.  If I need to update 1.1, I copy it into a new RC folder and squash bugs or add new cool stuff.  The best part is that all this is done within Dropbox so it’s backed up and versioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMeh. What about source control.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing it needs is source control.  Because it’s just myself, I don’t really run into me overwriting my own changes because I didn’t properly check something out/in.  But to make this a valid solution, it would obviously need some way of controlling edits and commits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother necessity would be to create a copy with every save.  The source control can back up the file before overwriting it to a specified folder in the Dropbox space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, it’s not very robust on it’s own, but it’s free and it’s robust \u003cem\u003eenough\u003c/em\u003e for a one-dev gig.  With some proper planning, it can probably work with multiples but why when SVN is pretty cheap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Update]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, apparently this helps with source control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/\"\u003ehttp://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[/Update]\u003c/p\u003e"

        <p>Prior to my current position, I had no clue what SVN or GIT were.  I finally got a very thorough explanation of SVN and versioning in general a few weeks ago.  Like all concepts I learn, I started to examine areas that might benefit from not just SVN but the concept of versions and revisions.</p>
<p>The obvious place was my personal pool of ongoing projects.  But I know how I work with new things.  I get all “ooo shiny” and want to find a place for it even thought all it is is shiny – nothing more. With this in mind, I thought about where my projects currently reside: Dropbox. </p>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Dropbox has revisions!  Duh!  Using the methods explained to me but considering the size and use of my files, Dropbox is the perfect platform. I have accumulated about 4 gigs of extra space on my free account over the years; It already creates periodic revisions (<strike>I don’t believe it’s with every save, but that’s ok for my use</strike> it is with “every change”); and it syncs to all my other computers including my test server.</p>
<p>The test server, by the way, has symbolic links set up so when I save the file locally, it is immediately pushed to my web server for testing. No FTP required!</p>
<h3>Research is for weenies.</h3>
<p>I didn’t think to search if anyone already thought about this until recently.  Maybe I’m not searching with the right query, but I couldn't find much except “Hey! Here’s an idea!” which is less than helpful.</p>
<p>I did start reading up on the concepts behind SVN and GIT which helped a little.  Wiki: saving the day again.</p>
<p>[Update] I just found this link. I don’t have a problem with rollbacks but most of my projects are small.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8238399/dropbox-as-a-programmers-source-control">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8238399/dropbox-as-a-programmers-source-control</a></p>
<p>[/Update]</p>
<h3>SVN THIS!</h3>
<p>I have a web application that I am updating: DailyKittehEmail App.  The current stable version is 1.0 while the current development version I call RC. So the folder structure looks like this:</p>
<p>WEBAPPS &gt; DailyKittehEmail  &gt; 1.0, RC</p>
<p>The versioned folders are locked – I don’t edit those anymore. If I need to make an update, I copy the whole folder to an RC folder and work from there – this is how I branch or fork a version.  When I’m ready to commit that release, I give it a version based on the edits made and change the folder name to the new version number. The new folder structure will look like this:</p>
<p>WEBAPPS &gt; DailyKittehEmail &gt; 1.0, 1.1</p>
<p>During development, though, as I finish editing for the night, I update my release notes with that nights version number.  Discipline, lads and laddettes, discipline. The folder would stay as RC but I keep the log going.</p>
<p>So, the cycle continues.  If I need to update 1.1, I copy it into a new RC folder and squash bugs or add new cool stuff.  The best part is that all this is done within Dropbox so it’s backed up and versioned.</p>
<h3>Meh. What about source control.</h3>
<p>The one thing it needs is source control.  Because it’s just myself, I don’t really run into me overwriting my own changes because I didn’t properly check something out/in.  But to make this a valid solution, it would obviously need some way of controlling edits and commits.</p>
<p>Another necessity would be to create a copy with every save.  The source control can back up the file before overwriting it to a specified folder in the Dropbox space.</p>
<p>Ok, it’s not very robust on it’s own, but it’s free and it’s robust <em>enough</em> for a one-dev gig.  With some proper planning, it can probably work with multiples but why when SVN is pretty cheap.</p>
<p>[Update]</p>
<p>Also, apparently this helps with source control</p>
