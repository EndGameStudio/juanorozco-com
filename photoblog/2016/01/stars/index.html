## Photo a day

One thing I learned is that &quot;infinity&quot; is relative to the [Sony kit lens](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bhphotovideo.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;product&#x2F;892390-REG&#x2F;Sony_selp1650_16_50mm_F_3_5_5_6_Power_Zoom.html). As I was setting up, I set the focus to manual and focused all the way to infinity. I kept getting shots that were very blurry. After some experimenting in the subfreezing temperatures of my backyard, I realized that the infinity is a &quot;range&quot;. WEIRD. I suspect it is due to this lens being a zoom lens; I bet a prime wouldn&#39;t do this.">
