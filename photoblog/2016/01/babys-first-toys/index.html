## Photo a day

I would consider this my first failure at taking a valid photo every day. I knew the photo was blurry and I need to bring out the tripod to try again. Unfortunately, the day got busy and I chose bed over photography.

This sorta thing happens as a working parent with a hobby. In fact, I&#39;m surprised it took 30 days for it to happen -  I figured it would have happened week 1!

Anyway, baby! I&#39;m a fan of wooden toys. I didn&#39;t find out about [Little Sapling Toys](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.littlesaplingtoys.com&#x2F;) until after our first two were out of the baby stage.  Super excited that &quot;Super Human Experiment 03&quot; gets to chew on natural materials instead of nasty plastics.">
