## Photo a day

When I finally bought my Sony a6000, the fiery passion for photography was reignited within me. I started the photo a day with the intention of just using my a6000. I don&#39;t have a wide angle lens that I can use but the GoPro takes really good photos. So, I decided that I would use *any* camera at my disposal to take photos for Photo A Day. This includes...

- my a6000, the kit lenses it came with and any lens I can use with an adapter (reusing my FD mount lenses is so much fun)
- GoPro Hero 4
- iPhone 6">
