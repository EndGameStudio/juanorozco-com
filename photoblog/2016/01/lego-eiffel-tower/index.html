## Photo a day

Not happy with this one at all but it is late. I don&#39;t have a remote trigger for my camera, but I should have used the timer to set the camera off. I think I the shot would have been clearer that way.

I had some Christmas lights in the background which gave it a nice effect but the light from the flash didn&#39;t match the color which bothers me. A lot.

Lastly, can you tell it is the Eiffel Tower from that angle? No. No, you can&#39;t. Welp. Fail and learn. :)">
