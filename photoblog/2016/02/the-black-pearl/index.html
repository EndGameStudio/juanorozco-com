## Photo a day

The story goes, she was once captained by one of the arrested criminals until she was liberated by the peacekeepers. The peacekeepers saw her potential for good and added her to the fleet.

They used the myth surrounding her to strike fear in the hearts of would-be crime committers.  That myth, or so it goes, is thus:

&gt; A fog will descend quickly, ominously; and within the fog lies judgement heralded by dancing luminous clouds of red and blue. Within the fog, if ye be guilty, awaits your destiny. Within the fog you will find the Black Pearl.

Be weary, friends, the Black Pearl is no legend. **[She is real](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsobserver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;counties&#x2F;wake-county&#x2F;article18576800.html).**">
