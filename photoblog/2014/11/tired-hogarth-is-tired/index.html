        <meta name="Description" content="I am a web applications engineer working in Raleigh, North Carolina. Originally from Ventura, California, I carry the ocean in my soul; my style is laid back but passionate. I'm a self proclaimed anthropologist, writer, and photographer. I make RL things as well as web things. I suppose if you need more I could also add husband, father, mild foodie, architecture appreciator, and tinkerer.">
