        <p>The scariest part of this crisis is how bad it is <em>now</em> and knowing that it will soon get worse.</p>
<p>I'm trying to separate my fears from where I am now, that is, I'm trying to focus on what can I do <em>right now</em>. This is hard. We had big plans this year, we wanted to sell the house and finally fulfill our dream of full-time RVing. I'm not sure what that looks like now. As I process my feelings, though, I remember that there are more important priorities. Staying safe and helping where we can are our top 10 priorities.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone should feel guilty for thinking selfishly or feeling depressed. I think we're all just trying to cope. Still, we need to figure out what to do next, what is the next action that moves us closer to a goal.</p>
<p>For us, for me, the goals are making sure we don't get sick, helping where we can, and be a positive role model for others. We're also trying to look ahead and make sure we're making good decisions for our future.</p>
<p>We are going to get through this - we'll definitely all be different because of it, though. The decisions we make together right now will dictate if we are better or worse when this is over. We can feel selfish and act selfishly which makes us selfish. Or we can feel selfish and act courageously which makes us brave.</p>
<p>It's ok to think selfishly but we can't let that rule our actions.</p>
