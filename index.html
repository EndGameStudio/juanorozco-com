    <p>I am a <strong>web applications engineer</strong> working in Raleigh, North Carolina. Originally from Ventura, California, I carry the ocean in my soul; my style is laid back but passionate.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a self proclaimed anthropologist, writer, and photographer. I make RL things as well as web things. I suppose if you need more I could also add husband, father, mild foodie, architecture appreciator, and tinkerer.</p>
<p>Put simply, though, I am a <span class="motto">wonderer, explorer, and creator</span>.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>You can find me being social in the usual nerdy places. <a href="https://twitter.com/guamaso">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/juanthedesigner/">Flickr</a>. I try to stick to the handle <strong>@guamaso</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>I&#39;m currently a web developer at <a href="http://bitovi.com">Bitovi</a> (We&#39;re an awesome team of devs and designers that get stuff done. We should <a href="http://bitovi.com/development">work together</a>!).</p>
<p>I publish a few things on <a href="https://github.com/Macrofig">Github</a> and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~macrofig">NPM</a>. I appreciate any feedback you can provide!</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>I also do a little bit of writing...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dev.endgamestudio.com">Dev Journal</a> - I log my thoughts on web development and also chronicle my growth as an engineer.</li>
<li><a href="http://exitzaero.com">ExitZaero</a> - Gaming and games.</li>
<li><a href="http://creativeandflow.com">Creative and Flow</a> - A magazine about creativity, exploration, wonder, and failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-">More...</h2>
<p>I try to keep my <a href="http://about.me/juanorozco">about.me</a> page fairly current.</p>
