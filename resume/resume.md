## Personal Summary

My wonder and zeal for inventing and exploring is at the core of my many passions. As a designer and wannabe engineer, I focused on Industrial Design. I also expressed  a passion for writing, photography, and anthropology. I pivoted and turned to the web. Finding a world ripe with new exploration opportunities, I dove in with the aim of learning as much as possible in order to express all my passions. 

Through my diverse work experiences over the past ten years, I have honed my skills as a web developer; first as a server-side craftsman.  I then moved on to front-end development and, now, focus on User Experience and mentoring. More recently, I publish thoughts on creativity, web engineering, and gaming through the web.

The web is still in a formative state, which encourages exploration and community. Within this dynamic, I continue to learn and participate in all aspects of web application development, self publishing through the web, and the sharing of knowledge.

## Objective

I am at my best when creating innovative, inspiring, challenging, and fun solutions within a respectful and creative company, alongside talented and friendly team members.
