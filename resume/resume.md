> Do what is right, be transparent, communicate often, take care of yourself so you can take care of others

I incorporated these values after years of working with challenging teams and people. My goals focus on my zeal for building useful and delightful things.

I constantly seek out learning opportunities and strive to share my knowledge. I don’t believe in management, I believe in mentorship. I inspire teams to break their limits and help them deliver the best product possible. I seek out passionate people who value themselves, their team, and the worlds they build.
